## What is Code Buddy Club?

- It's similar to a book club but uses free courses and tutorials instead of books.
- Participants are free to code independently, or to pair program.
- Meet on discord to share progress, provide support, and help with debugging.
- Each course should take roughly 1 to 5 weeks to complete.
- It's a really relaxed, supportive, and social atmosphere.

## Where Will It Be?

On TorontoJS discord server. There's a dedicated Code Buddy Club channel. 
- Why on discord? 
		1.  Great place to have streaming and screen sharing
		2. Because this is knowledge that we want to persist, and Slack eats messages.
## Why?

- Sami and Liz have been code buddies since October. 
- It's been really fun, 
- It's helpful to have someone to share and debug the same projects
- Being part of a group helps with motivation  and accountability by set goals for things to complete
- We're excited about opening this up to other devs in Toronto JS.
## How Has The Schedule Been Developed?

Sami and Liz have found that going all out they have been able to get though 1-2 hours of tutorial videos per week. However, not everyone will have that time. A much more relaxed pace is more inclusive. So there's about 30 minutes of tutorial video per week. Some weeks have two shorter courses. Longer courses span two or more weeks. The longest course is five weeks long.

All the courses are free courses. The majority are on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io) because the quality is good. There are also some from YouTube, and [Wes Bos's free courses](https://wesbos.com/courses). 

Due to the changes with React in 2023, specifically the depreciation of create react app (CRA) courses with react that are older than 6 months have been avoided, with the exception of web accessibility courses.

We have tried to alternate between shorter courses and slightly longer ones to give people the chance to join Code Buddy Club at almost any month of the year.
