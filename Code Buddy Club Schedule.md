## What is a Code Buddy Club?

- It's similar to a book club but uses free courses and tutorials instead of books.
- Participants are free to code independently, or to pair program.
- Meet on discord to share progress, provide support, and help with debugging.
- Each course should take roughly 1 to 5 weeks to complete.
- Some weeks have two shorter courses
- It's a really relaxed, supportive, and social atmosphere.

## In Person End of Season Brunch!

## Notes

1. If your Git skills are rusty, need an upgrade, or you just want to improve them the free Egghead.io course [Practical Git for Everyday Professional Use](https://egghead.io/courses/practical-git-for-everyday-professional-use) is highly recommended either before the first week of Code Buddy, or during the first week when we focus on Git and GitHub.
2. If you want to dive deeper into Auth0 the free Egghead.io course [Custom Authentication Flows for Modern Applications with Auth0 Actions](https://egghead.io/courses/custom-authentication-flows-for-modern-applications-with-auth0-actions-c51aa3bc)by [Will Johnson](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-will-johnson) is just 32 minutes long
3. Lazar Nikolov is a Toronto JS member! 
	1. His website and discord server is [Creatures.dev](https://creatures.dev)
	2. His [Build a Full Stack Blog with Astro](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-full-stack-blog-with-astro-7ffcf9ec) course on Egghead.io is well worth a month of paid Egghead pro ($25 USD). Both Sami and Liz have completed it. Marco is redoing his blog with Astro after Liz and Sami's experience.
4. LinkedIn Learning courses are avaiable free though Toronto Public Library (sign in with your library card), most other Greater Toronto Hamilton Region (GTHA) public libraries and if you have a LinkedIn Premium subscription.
