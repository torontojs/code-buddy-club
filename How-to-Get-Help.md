# How to Get Help With Your Code

If you're having issues with a particular part of a course:

Ask your question in the discussion forum for that course.
The general chat is for talking about learning, asking about dates/times, finding someone to pair program with and "water cooler" chat.

**See markdown in Discord tips below before posting a question.**
Discord supports markdown for formatting text and code.

## Please include:

1. Link to the video and the time stamp.  
If it's a YouTube video, you can opt to share starting at the time stamp instead of the beginning of the video.
  
2. A description of the error

3. Your code
Using 3 back ticks ` above and below your code turns it into syntax highlighted code.
  
4. A link to your GitHub.

5. A screenshot of your file structure.

## Markdown Tips

1. Links:
format is: [ name of link ]( url )
_Do not include the spaces between the text and the brackets_

2. Code syntax highlighting. Discord supports language specific code syntax highlighting. 

Use the following:
a. Three backticks followed by the name of the language
b. Your code
c. Three backticks

So for html:

```html
<a href=https://example.com>Example</>
```

**Other common languages:**

- css is css
- javascript is javascript
- C# is csharp
